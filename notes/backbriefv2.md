# Issue



I think that the main problem is that REG and the wider business essentially does not know (accurately) how much time is spent on projects. This is an obstacle to fairly billing clients and  knowing the availability of team members when projects are due to start. We should work towards fixing these basic issues as a first step.

There is currently no straightforward way to see what work is going in the team, when team members will be available for projects, when new projects are due to start, how long we spend on projects (for billing purposes),  alonger term view (6 months+) etc.



Current and future projects at the institute are recorded separately in REG, finance, and other teams. There is a need for a 'one true source'.



  The team also needs an easy way to regularly view and track work, time and projects. 
  This should still include a straightforward way for team members to record the time they spend their projects on. 
  At the moment, the team is content to continue to use Harvest for data collection. 
  We record enough data to re-create the physical whiteboard and people's past projects and experience.
	
	# Key users and customers
	* Oliver (project lead)
	* Martin
	* Amber/ finance/ Gabriel
	* James G
	* REG team
	# Key requirements
    
    
	At a minimum we need to accurately record time spent on projects, what the original time and resource allocated to a project was and project identifiers.
    
    
	Items collected in initial stages should be: 
	* team member
	* project
	* time spent
	* client
	* estimated start and end date
	* project duration
    
	# Currently out of scope
    
	* Ability to zoom out to 6 monthly or year view
	* Including every available partner (universities + capacity and commercial partners)
	* Recording assets for financial reporting
	* Consistent codes for reporting (potentially across institute)
    
	# To consider during project
    
	What data do we really need and want to collect? 
	How do we define what a project is? 
	How do we want to engage the team and ensure that they need it?
    
	## User needs
    
	### James G
	A live version of the whiteboard previously used in the team. 
    
	### Martin
	A way to allocate and report ongoing and future work. Further down the line this could include a way to see who can work on a project (like people's interests on github or a skills preference match).
    
	### Oliver
	To see if Harvest and forecast are suitable tools. A spreadsheet to pass on to finance that contains information about how long team members spend on projects.
    
	### Amber/ finance
	An accurate and easy way to see projects undertaken in REG.
    
	### Gabriel
	To ensure that data across the organisation is consistent and to track project milestones.
