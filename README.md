***Issue***

In REG, there is currently no straightforward way to see what work is going in the team, when team members will be available for projects, when new projects are due to start, how long we spend on projects (for billing purposes), longer term view (6 months+) etc. 
Current and future projects at the institute are recorded separately in REG, finance, and other teams.

***Solution/ outcomes***

Ideally, the team would like an easy way to regularly view and track work, time and projects. This should still include a straightforward way for team members to record the time they spend their projects on. At the moment, the team is content to continue to use Harvest.

***Key users and customers***

* Oliver
* Martin
* Amber/ finance
* James G
* REG team

***Key requirements***

Output should be a spreadsheet
Items collected in initial stages should be: 
* team member
* project
* time spent
* client
* estimated start and end date
* project duration
    
***Currently out of scope***

* Ability to zoom out to 6 monthly or year view
* Including every available partner (universities + capacity and commercial partners)
* Recording assets for financial reporting
* Consistent codes for reporting (potentially across institute)

***To consider during project***

What data do we really need and want to collect? 
How do we define what a project is? I don't think that we should record assets in this way.

## User needs (please keep brief)

***James G***

A live version of the whiteboard previously used in the team. 

***Martin***

A way to allocate and report ongoing and future work. Further down the line this could include a way to see who can work on a project (like people's interests on github or a skills preference match).

***Oliver***

To see if Harvest and forecast are suitable tools. A spreadsheet to pass on to finance that contains information about how long team members spend on projects.

***Amber/ finance***

An accurate and easy way to see projects undertaken in REG.

***Gabriel***

To ensure that data across the organisation is consistent and to track project milestones.
